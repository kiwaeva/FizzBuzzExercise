FizzBuzz

Write a program that allows the user to enter a number, print each number
between one and the number the user entered, but for numbers that divide by 3
without a remainder print Fizz instead. For numbers that divide by 5 without 
a remainder print Buzz and finally for numbers that divide by both 3 and 5 
without a remainder print FizzBuzz.

1) Write a pseudocode:

When a user inputs a number
Loop from 1 to the entered number
If the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
If the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise print the current number
 
2) Write the code
